NAME
       ffmpeg-utils - FFmpeg utilities

DESCRIPTION
       This document describes some generic features and utilities provided by
       the libavutil library.

SYNTAX
       This section documents the syntax and formats employed by the FFmpeg
       libraries and tools.

   Quoting and escaping
       FFmpeg adopts the following quoting and escaping mechanism, unless
       explicitly specified. The following rules are applied:

       ·   ' and \ are special characters (respectively used for quoting and
	   escaping). In addition to them, there might be other special
	   characters depending on the specific syntax where the escaping and
	   quoting are employed.

       ·   A special character is escaped by prefixing it with a \.

       ·   All characters enclosed between '' are included literally in the
	   parsed string. The quote character ' itself cannot be quoted, so
	   you may need to close the quote and escape it.

       ·   Leading and trailing whitespaces, unless escaped or quoted, are
	   removed from the parsed string.

       Note that you may need to add a second level of escaping when using the
       command line or a script, which depends on the syntax of the adopted
       shell language.

       The function "av_get_token" defined in libavutil/avstring.h can be used
       to parse a token quoted or escaped according to the rules defined
       above.

       The tool tools/ffescape in the FFmpeg source tree can be used to
       automatically quote or escape a string in a script.

       Examples

       ·   Escape the string "Crime d'Amour" containing the "'" special
	   character:

		   Crime d\'Amour

       ·   The string above contains a quote, so the "'" needs to be escaped
	   when quoting it:

		   'Crime d'\''Amour'

       ·   Include leading or trailing whitespaces using quoting:

		   '  this string starts and ends with whitespaces  '

       ·   Escaping and quoting can be mixed together:

		   ' The string '\'string\'' is a string '

       ·   To include a literal \ you can use either escaping or quoting:

		   'c:\foo' can be written as c:\\foo

   Date
       The accepted syntax is:

	       [(YYYY-MM-DD|YYYYMMDD)[T|t| ]]((HH:MM:SS[.m...]]])|(HHMMSS[.m...]]]))[Z]
	       now

       If the value is "now" it takes the current time.

       Time is local time unless Z is appended, in which case it is
       interpreted as UTC.  If the year-month-day part is not specified it
       takes the current year-month-day.

   Time duration
       There are two accepted syntaxes for expressing time duration.

	       [-][<HH>:]<MM>:<SS>[.<m>...]

       HH expresses the number of hours, MM the number of minutes for a
       maximum of 2 digits, and SS the number of seconds for a maximum of 2
       digits. The m at the end expresses decimal value for SS.

       or

	       [-]<S>+[.<m>...]

       S expresses the number of seconds, with the optional decimal part m.

       In both expressions, the optional - indicates negative duration.

       Examples

       The following examples are all valid time duration:

       55  55 seconds

       12:03:45
	   12 hours, 03 minutes and 45 seconds

       23.189
	   23.189 seconds

   Video size
       Specify the size of the sourced video, it may be a string of the form
       widthxheight, or the name of a size abbreviation.

   Video rate
       Specify the frame rate of a video, expressed as the number of frames
       generated per second. It has to be a string in the format
       frame_rate_num/frame_rate_den, an integer number, a float number or a
       valid video frame rate abbreviation.

       The following abbreviations are recognized:

       ntsc
	   30000/1001

       pal 25/1

       qntsc
	   30000/1001

       ntsc-film
	   24000/1001

   Ratio
       A ratio can be expressed as an expression, or in the form
       numerator:denominator.

       Note that a ratio with infinite (1/0) or negative value is considered
       valid, so you should check on the returned value if you want to exclude
       those values.

       The undefined value can be expressed using the "0:0" string.

   Color
       It can be the name of a color as defined below (case insensitive match)
       or a "[0x|#]RRGGBB[AA]" sequence, possibly followed by @ and a string
       representing the alpha component.

       The alpha component may be a string composed by "0x" followed by an
       hexadecimal number or a decimal number between 0.0 and 1.0, which
       represents the opacity value (0x00 or 0.0 means completely transparent,
       0xff or 1.0 completely opaque). If the alpha component is not specified
       then 0xff is assumed.

       The string random will result in a random color.

   Channel Layout
       A channel layout specifies the spatial disposition of the channels in a
       multi-channel audio stream. To specify a channel layout, FFmpeg makes
       use of a special syntax.

       Individual channels are identified by an id, as given by the table
       below:

       FL  front left

       FR  front right

       FC  front center

       LFE low frequency

       BL  back left

       BR  back right

       FLC front left-of-center

       FRC front right-of-center

       BC  back center

       SL  side left

       SR  side right

       TC  top center

       TFL top front left

       TFC top front center

       TFR top front right

       TBL top back left

       TBC top back center

       TBR top back right

       DL  downmix left

       DR  downmix right

       WL  wide left

       WR  wide right

       SDL surround direct left

       SDR surround direct right

       LFE2
	   low frequency 2

       Standard channel layout compositions can be specified by using the
       following identifiers:

       mono
	   FC

       stereo
	   FL+FR

       2.1 FL+FR+LFE

       3.0 FL+FR+FC

       3.0(back)
	   FL+FR+BC

       4.0 FL+FR+FC+BC

       6.1(front)
	   FL+FR+LFE+FLC+FRC+SL+SR

       7.0 FL+FR+FC+BL+BR+SL+SR

       7.0(front)
	   FL+FR+FC+FLC+FRC+SL+SR

       7.1 FL+FR+FC+LFE+BL+BR+SL+SR

       7.1(wide)
	   FL+FR+FC+LFE+BL+BR+FLC+FRC

       A custom channel layout can be specified as a sequence of terms,
       separated by '+' or '|'. Each term can be:

       ·   the name of a standard channel layout (e.g. mono, stereo, 4.0,
	   quad, 5.0, etc.)

       ·   the name of a single channel (e.g. FL, FR, FC, LFE, etc.)

       ·   a number of channels, in decimal, optionally followed by 'c',
	   yielding the default channel layout for that number of channels
	   (see the function "av_get_default_channel_layout")

       ·   a channel layout mask, in hexadecimal starting with "0x" (see the
	   "AV_CH_*" macros in libavutil/channel_layout.h.

       Starting from libavutil version 53 the trailing character "c" to
       specify a number of channels will be required, while a channel layout
       mask could also be specified as a decimal number (if and only if not
       followed by "c").

       See also the function "av_get_channel_layout" defined in
       libavutil/channel_layout.h.

EXPRESSION EVALUATION
       When evaluating an arithmetic expression, FFmpeg uses an internal
       formula evaluator, implemented through the libavutil/eval.h interface.

       An expression may contain unary, binary operators, constants, and
       functions.

       Two expressions expr1 and expr2 can be combined to form another
       expression "expr1;expr2".  expr1 and expr2 are evaluated in turn, and
       the new expression evaluates to the value of expr2.

       The following binary operators are available: "+", "-", "*", "/", "^".

       The following unary operators are available: "+", "-".

       The following functions are available:

       abs(x)
	   Compute absolute value of x.

       bitor(x, y)
	   Compute bitwise and/or operation on x and y.

	   The results of the evaluation of x and y are converted to integers
	   before executing the bitwise operation.

	   Note that both the conversion to integer and the conversion back to
	   floating point can lose precision. Beware of unexpected results for
	   large numbers (usually 2^53 and larger).

	   Return 1 if x is greater than or equal to y, 0 otherwise.

       hypot(x, y)
	   This function is similar to the C function with the same name; it
	   returns "sqrt(x*x + y*y)", the length of the hypotenuse of a right
	   triangle with sides of length x and y, or the distance of the point
	   (x, y) from the origin.

	   previously stored with st(var, expr).  The function returns the
	   loaded value.

       log(x)
	   Compute natural logarithm of x.

       lt(x, y)
	   Return 1 if x is lesser than y, 0 otherwise.

	   the expression printed.

	   Prints t with loglevel l

       random(x)
	   Return a pseudo random value between 0.0 and 1.0. x is the index of
	   the internal variable which will be used to save the seed/state.

       root(expr, max)
	   Find an input value for which the function represented by expr with
	   argument ld(0) is 0 in the interval 0..max.

	   The expression in expr must denote a continuous function or the
	   result is undefined.

	   ld(0) is used to represent the function input value, which means
	   that the given expression will be evaluated multiple times with
	   various input values that the expression can access through ld(0).
	   When the expression evaluates to 0 then the corresponding input
	   value will be returned.

       sin(x)
	   Compute sine of x.

       sinh(x)
	   Compute hyperbolic sine of x.

       sqrt(expr)

	   Compute expression "1/(1 + exp(4*x))".

       st(var, expr)
	   Store the value of the expression expr in an internal variable. var
	   specifies the number of the variable where to store the value, and
	   it is a value ranging from 0 to 9. The function returns the value
	   stored in the internal variable.  Note, Variables are currently not
	   shared between expressions.

       tan(x)
	   Compute tangent of x.

       tanh(x)
	   Compute hyperbolic tangent of x.

       taylor(expr, x)
       taylor(expr, x, id)
	   Evaluate a Taylor series at x, given an expression representing the
	   "ld(id)"-th derivative of a function at 0.

	   When the series does not converge the result is undefined.

	   ld(id) is used to represent the derivative order in expr, which
	   means that the given expression will be evaluated multiple times
	   with various input values that the expression can access through
	   "ld(id)". If id is not specified then 0 is assumed.

	   Note, when you have the derivatives at y instead of 0,
	   "taylor(expr, x-y)" can be used.

       time(0)
	   Return the current (wallclock) time in seconds.

       trunc(expr)
	   Round the value of expression expr towards zero to the nearest
	   integer. For example, "trunc(-1.5)" is "-1.0".

       while(cond, expr)
	   Evaluate expression expr while the expression cond is non-zero, and
	   returns the value of the last expr evaluation, or NAN if cond was
	   always false.

       The following constants are available:

       PI  area of the unit disc, approximately 3.14

       E   exp(1) (Euler's number), approximately 2.718

       PHI golden ratio (1+sqrt(5))/2, approximately 1.618

       Assuming that an expression is considered "true" if it has a non-zero
       value, note that:

       "*" works like AND

       "+" works like OR

       For example the construct:

	       if (A AND B) then C

       is equivalent to:

	       if(A*B, C)

       In your C code, you can extend the list of unary and binary functions,
       and define recognized constants, so that they are available for your
       expressions.

       The evaluator also recognizes the International System unit prefixes.
       If 'i' is appended after the prefix, binary prefixes are used, which
       are based on powers of 1024 instead of powers of 1000.  The 'B' postfix
       multiplies the value by 8, and can be appended after a unit prefix or
       used alone. This allows using for example 'KB', 'MiB', 'G' and 'B' as
       number postfix.

       The list of available International System prefixes follows, with
       indication of the corresponding powers of 10 and of 2.
