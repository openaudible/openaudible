NAME
       ffmpeg - ffmpeg video converter

SYNOPSIS
       ffmpeg [global_options] {[input_file_options] -i input_file} ...
       {[output_file_options] output_file} ...

DESCRIPTION
       ffmpeg is a very fast video and audio converter that can also grab from
       a live audio/video source. It can also convert between arbitrary sample
       rates and resize video on the fly with a high quality polyphase filter.

       ffmpeg reads from an arbitrary number of input "files" (which can be
       regular files, pipes, network streams, grabbing devices, etc.),
       specified by the "-i" option, and writes to an arbitrary number of
       output "files", which are specified by a plain output filename.
       Anything found on the command line which cannot be interpreted as an
       option is considered to be an output filename.

       Each input or output file can, in principle, contain any number of
       streams of different types (video/audio/subtitle/attachment/data). The
       allowed number and/or types of streams may be limited by the container
       format. Selecting which streams from which inputs will go into which
       output is either done automatically or with the "-map" option (see the
       Stream selection chapter).

       To refer to input files in options, you must use their indices
       (0-based). E.g.	the first input file is 0, the second is 1, etc.
       Similarly, streams within a file are referred to by their indices. E.g.
       "2:3" refers to the fourth stream in the third input file. Also see the
       Stream specifiers chapter.

       As a general rule, options are applied to the next specified file.
       Therefore, order is important, and you can have the same option on the
       command line multiple times. Each occurrence is then applied to the
       next input or output file.  Exceptions from this rule are the global
       options (e.g. verbosity level), which should be specified first.

       Do not mix input and output files -- first specify all input files,
       then all output files. Also do not mix options which belong to
       different files. All options apply ONLY to the next input or output
       file and are reset between files.

       ·   To set the video bitrate of the output file to 64 kbit/s:

		   ffmpeg -i input.avi -b:v 64k -bufsize 64k output.avi

       ·   To force the frame rate of the output file to 24 fps:

		   ffmpeg -i input.avi -r 24 output.avi

       ·   To force the frame rate of the input file (valid for raw formats
	   only) to 1 fps and the frame rate of the output file to 24 fps:

		   ffmpeg -r 1 -i input.m2v -r 24 output.avi

       The format option may be needed for raw input files.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
       The transcoding process in ffmpeg for each output can be described by
       the following diagram:

		_______ 	     ______________
	       |       |	    |		   |
	       | input |  demuxer   | encoded data |   decoder

						     |_________|
		________	     ______________	  |
	       |	|	    |		   |	  |
	       | output | <-------- | encoded data | <----+
	       | file	|   muxer   | packets	   |   encoder
	       |________|	    |______________|

       ffmpeg calls the libavformat library (containing demuxers) to read
       input files and get packets containing encoded data from them. When
       there are multiple input files, ffmpeg tries to keep them synchronized
       by tracking lowest timestamp on any active input stream.

       Encoded packets are then passed to the decoder (unless streamcopy is
       selected for the stream, see further for a description). The decoder
       produces uncompressed frames (raw video/PCM audio/...) which can be
       processed further by filtering (see next section). After filtering, the
       frames are passed to the encoder, which encodes them and outputs
       encoded packets. Finally those are passed to the muxer, which writes
       the encoded packets to the output file.

   Filtering
       Before encoding, ffmpeg can process raw audio and video frames using
       filters from the libavfilter library. Several chained filters form a
       filter graph. ffmpeg distinguishes between two types of filtergraphs:
       simple and complex.

       Simple filtergraphs

       Simple filtergraphs are those that have exactly one input and output,
       both of the same type. In the above diagram they can be represented by
       simply inserting an additional step between decoding and encoding:

		_________			 ______________
	       |	 |			|	       |
	       | decoded |			| encoded data |
	       | frames  |\		      _ | packets      |
	       |_________| \		      /||______________|
			    \	__________   /
		 simple     _\||	  | /  encoder
		 filtergraph   | filtered |/
			       | frames   |
			       |__________|

       Simple filtergraphs are configured with the per-stream -filter option
       (with -vf and -af aliases for video and audio respectively).  A simple
       filtergraph for video can look for example like this:

		_______        _____________	    _______	   ________
	       |       |      | 	    |	   |	   |	  |	   |
	       | input | ---> | deinterlace | ---> | scale | ---> | output |
	       |_______|      |_____________|	   |_______|	  |________|

       Note that some filters change frame properties but not frame contents.
       E.g. the "fps" filter in the example above changes number of frames,
       but does not touch the frame contents. Another example is the "setpts"
       filter, which only sets timestamps and otherwise passes the frames
       unchanged.

       Complex filtergraphs

       Complex filtergraphs are those which cannot be described as simply a
       linear processing chain applied to one stream. This is the case, for
       example, when the graph has more than one input and/or output, or when
       output stream type is different from input. They can be represented
       with the following diagram:

		_________
	       |	 |
	       | input 0 |\		       __________
	       |_________| \		      | 	 |
			    \	_________    /| output 0 |
			     \ |	 |  / |__________|
		_________     \| complex | /
	       |	 |     |	 |/
	       | input 1 |---->| filter  |\
	       |_________|     |	 | \   __________
			      /| graph	 |  \ | 	 |
			     / |	 |   \| output 1 |
		_________   /  |_________|    |__________|
	       |	 | /
	       | input 2 |/
	       |_________|

       Complex filtergraphs are configured with the -filter_complex option.
       Note that this option is global, since a complex filtergraph, by its
       nature, cannot be unambiguously associated with a single stream or
       file.

       The -lavfi option is equivalent to -filter_complex.

       A trivial example of a complex filtergraph is the "overlay" filter,
       which has two video inputs and one video output, containing one video
       overlaid on top of the other. Its audio counterpart is the "amix"
       filter.

   Stream copy
       Stream copy is a mode selected by supplying the "copy" parameter to the
       -codec option. It makes ffmpeg omit the decoding and encoding step for
       the specified stream, so it does only demuxing and muxing. It is useful
       for changing the container format or modifying container-level
       metadata. The diagram above will, in this case, simplify to this:

		_______ 	     ______________	       ________
	       |       |	    |		   |	      |        |
	       | input |  demuxer   | encoded data |  muxer   | output |
	       | file  | ---------> | packets	   | -------> | file   |
	       |_______|	    |______________|	      |________|

       Since there is no decoding or encoding, it is very fast and there is no
       quality loss. However, it might not work in some cases because of many
       factors. Applying filters is obviously also impossible, since filters
       work on uncompressed data.

STREAM SELECTION
       By default, ffmpeg includes only one stream of each type (video, audio,
       subtitle) present in the input files and adds them to each output file.
       It picks the "best" of each based upon the following criteria: for
       video, it is the stream with the highest resolution, for audio, it is
       the stream with the most channels, for subtitles, it is the first
       subtitle stream. In the case where several streams of the same type
       rate equally, the stream with the lowest index is chosen.

       You can disable some of those defaults by using the "-vn/-an/-sn"
       options. For full manual control, use the "-map" option, which disables
       the defaults just described.

OPTIONS
       All the numerical options, if not specified otherwise, accept a string
       representing a number as input, which may be followed by one of the SI
       unit prefixes, for example: 'K', 'M', or 'G'.

       If 'i' is appended to the SI unit prefix, the complete prefix will be
       interpreted as a unit prefix for binary multiples, which are based on
       powers of 1024 instead of powers of 1000. Appending 'B' to the SI unit
       prefix multiplies the value by 8. This allows using, for example: 'KB',
       'MiB', 'G' and 'B' as number suffixes.

       Options which do not take arguments are boolean options, and set the
       corresponding value to true. They can be set to false by prefixing the
       option name with "no". For example using "-nofoo" will set the boolean
       option with name "foo" to false.

   Stream specifiers
       Some options are applied per-stream, e.g. bitrate or codec. Stream
       specifiers are used to precisely specify which stream(s) a given option
       belongs to.

       A stream specifier is a string generally appended to the option name
       and separated from it by a colon. E.g. "-codec:a:1 ac3" contains the
       "a:1" stream specifier, which matches the second audio stream.
       Therefore, it would select the ac3 codec for the second audio stream.

       A stream specifier can match several streams, so that the option is
       applied to all of them. E.g. the stream specifier in "-b:a 128k"
       matches all audio streams.

       An empty stream specifier matches all streams. For example, "-codec
       copy" or "-codec: copy" would copy all the streams without reencoding.

       Possible forms of stream specifiers are:

       stream_index
	   Matches the stream with this index. E.g. "-threads:1 4" would set
	   the thread count for the second stream to 4.

       stream_type[:stream_index]
	   stream_type is one of following: 'v' or 'V' for video, 'a' for
	   audio, 's' for subtitle, 'd' for data, and 't' for attachments. 'v'
	   matches all video streams, 'V' only matches video streams which are
	   not attached pictures, video thumbnails or cover arts.  If
	   stream_index is given, then it matches stream number stream_index
	   of this type. Otherwise, it matches all streams of this type.

       p:program_id[:stream_index]
	   If stream_index is given, then it matches the stream with number
	   stream_index in the program with the id program_id. Otherwise, it
	   matches all streams in the program.

       #stream_id or i:stream_id
	   Match the stream by stream id (e.g. PID in MPEG-TS container).

       m:key[:value]
	   Matches streams with the metadata tag key having the specified
	   value. If value is not given, matches streams that contain the
	   given tag with any value.

       u   Matches streams with usable configuration, the codec must be
	   defined and the essential information such as video dimension or
	   audio sample rate must be present.

	   Note that in ffmpeg, matching by metadata will only work properly
	   for input files.

	   Show autodetected sources of the intput device.  Some devices may
	   provide system-dependent source names that cannot be autodetected.
	   The returned list cannot be assumed to be always complete.

		   ffmpeg -sources pulse,server=192.168.0.4

       -sinks device[,opt1=val1[,opt2=val2]...]
	   Show autodetected sinks of the output device.  Some devices may
	   provide system-dependent sink names that cannot be autodetected.
	   The returned list cannot be assumed to be always complete.

		   ffmpeg -sinks pulse,server=192.168.0.4

       -loglevel [repeat+]loglevel | -v [repeat+]loglevel
	   Set the logging level used by the library.  Adding "repeat+"
	   indicates that repeated log output should not be compressed to the
	   first line and the "Last message repeated n times" line will be
	   omitted. "repeat" can also be used alone.  If "repeat" is used
	   alone, and with no prior loglevel set, the default loglevel will be
	   used. If multiple loglevel parameters are given, using 'repeat'
	   will not change the loglevel.  loglevel is a string or a number
	   containing one of the following values:

	   quiet, -8
	       Show nothing at all; be silent.

	   panic, 0
	       Only show fatal errors which could lead the process to crash,
	       such as and assert failure. This is not currently used for
	       anything.

	   fatal, 8
	       Only show fatal errors. These are errors after which the
	       process absolutely cannot continue after.

	   error, 16
	       Show all errors, including ones which can be recovered from.

	   warning, 24
	       Show all warnings and errors. Any message related to possibly
	       incorrect or unexpected events will be shown.

	   info, 32
	       Show informative messages during processing. This is in
	       addition to warnings and errors. This is the default value.

	   verbose, 40
	       Same as "info", except more verbose.

	   debug, 48
	       Show everything, including debugging information.

	   trace, 56

	   By default the program logs to stderr, if coloring is supported by
	   the terminal, colors are used to mark errors and warnings. Log
	   coloring can be disabled setting the environment variable
	   AV_LOG_FORCE_NOCOLOR or NO_COLOR, or can be forced setting the
	   environment variable AV_LOG_FORCE_COLOR.  The use of the
	   environment variable NO_COLOR is deprecated and will be dropped in
	   a following FFmpeg version.

       -report
	   Dump full command line and console output to a file named
	   "program-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.log" in the current directory.  This file
	   can be useful for bug reports.  It also implies "-loglevel
	   verbose".

	   Setting the environment variable FFREPORT to any value has the same
	   effect. If the value is a ':'-separated key=value sequence, these
	   options will affect the report; option values must be escaped if
	   they contain special characters or the options delimiter ':' (see
	   the ``Quoting and escaping'' section in the ffmpeg-utils manual).

	   The following options are recognized:

	   file
	       set the file name to use for the report; %p is expanded to the
	       name of the program, %t is expanded to a timestamp, "%%" is
	       expanded to a plain "%"

	   level
	       set the log verbosity level using a numerical value (see
	       "-loglevel").

	   For example, to output a report to a file named ffreport.log using
	   a log level of 32 (alias for log level "info"):

		   FFREPORT=file=ffreport.log:level=32 ffmpeg -i input output

	   Errors in parsing the environment variable are not fatal, and will
	   not appear in the report.

       -hide_banner
	   Suppress printing banner.

	   All FFmpeg tools will normally show a copyright notice, build
	   options and library versions. This option can be used to suppress
	   printing this information.

       -cpuflags flags (global)
	   Allows setting and clearing cpu flags. This option is intended for
	   testing. Do not use it unless you know what you're doing.

		   ffmpeg -cpuflags -sse+mmx ...
		   ffmpeg -cpuflags mmx ...
		   ffmpeg -cpuflags 0 ...

	   Possible flags for this option are:

	   x86

       -opencl_bench
	   This option is used to benchmark all available OpenCL devices and
	   print the results. This option is only available when FFmpeg has
	   been compiled with "--enable-opencl".

	   When FFmpeg is configured with "--enable-opencl", the options for
	   the global OpenCL context are set via -opencl_options. See the
	   "OpenCL Options" section in the ffmpeg-utils manual for the
	   complete list of supported options. Amongst others, these options
	   include the ability to select a specific platform and device to run
	   the OpenCL code on. By default, FFmpeg will run on the first device
	   of the first platform. While the options for the global OpenCL
	   context provide flexibility to the user in selecting the OpenCL
	   device of their choice, most users would probably want to select
	   the fastest OpenCL device for their system.

	   This option assists the selection of the most efficient
	   configuration by identifying the appropriate device for the user's
	   system. The built-in benchmark is run on all the OpenCL devices and
	   the performance is measured for each device. The devices in the
	   results list are sorted based on their performance with the fastest
	   device listed first. The user can subsequently invoke ffmpeg using
	   the device deemed most appropriate via -opencl_options to obtain
	   the best performance for the OpenCL accelerated code.

	   Typical usage to use the fastest OpenCL device involve the
	   following steps.

	   Run the command:

		   ffmpeg -opencl_bench

	   Note down the platform ID (pidx) and device ID (didx) of the first
	   i.e. fastest device in the list.  Select the platform and device
	   using the command:

		   ffmpeg -opencl_options platform_idx=<pidx>:device_idx=<didx> ...

       -opencl_options options (global)
	   Set OpenCL environment options. This option is only available when
	   FFmpeg has been compiled with "--enable-opencl".

	   options must be a list of key=value option pairs separated by ':'.
	   See the ``OpenCL Options'' section in the ffmpeg-utils manual for
	   the list of supported options.

   AVOptions
       These options are provided directly by the libavformat, libavdevice and
       libavcodec libraries. To see the list of available AVOptions, use the
       -help option. They are separated into two categories:

       generic
	   These options can be set for any container, codec or device.
	   Generic options are listed under AVFormatContext options for
	   containers/devices and under AVCodecContext options for codecs.

       private
	   These options are specific to the given container, device or codec.
	   Private options are listed under their corresponding
	   containers/devices/codecs.

       For example to write an ID3v2.3 header instead of a default ID3v2.4 to
       an MP3 file, use the id3v2_version private option of the MP3 muxer:

	       ffmpeg -i input.flac -id3v2_version 3 out.mp3

       All codec AVOptions are per-stream, and thus a stream specifier should
       be attached to them.

       Note: the -nooption syntax cannot be used for boolean AVOptions, use
       -option 0/-option 1.

       Note: the old undocumented way of specifying per-stream AVOptions by
       prepending v/a/s to the options name is now obsolete and will be
       removed soon.

   Main options
       -f fmt (input/output)
	   Force input or output file format. The format is normally auto
	   detected for input files and guessed from the file extension for
	   output files, so this option is not needed in most cases.

       -i filename (input)
	   input file name

       -y (global)
	   Overwrite output files without asking.

       -n (global)
	   Do not overwrite output files, and exit immediately if a specified
	   output file already exists.

       -c[:stream_specifier] codec (input/output,per-stream)
       -codec[:stream_specifier] codec (input/output,per-stream)
	   Select an encoder (when used before an output file) or a decoder
	   (when used before an input file) for one or more streams. codec is
	   the name of a decoder/encoder or a special value "copy" (output
	   only) to indicate that the stream is not to be re-encoded.

	   For example

		   ffmpeg -i INPUT -map 0 -c:v libx264 -c:a copy OUTPUT

	   encodes all video streams with libx264 and copies all audio
	   streams.

	   For each stream, the last matching "c" option is applied, so

		   ffmpeg -i INPUT -map 0 -c copy -c:v:1 libx264 -c:a:137 libvorbis OUTPUT

	   will copy all the streams except the second video, which will be
	   encoded with libx264, and the 138th audio, which will be encoded
	   with libvorbis.

       -t duration (input/output)
	   When used as an input option (before "-i"), limit the duration of
	   data read from the input file.

	   When used as an output option (before an output filename), stop
	   writing the output after its duration reaches duration.

	   duration must be a time duration specification, see the Time
	   duration section in the ffmpeg-utils(1) manual.

	   -to and -t are mutually exclusive and -t has priority.

       -to position (output)
	   Stop writing the output at position.  position must be a time
	   duration specification, see the Time duration section in the
	   ffmpeg-utils(1) manual.

	   -to and -t are mutually exclusive and -t has priority.

       -fs limit_size (output)
	   Set the file size limit, expressed in bytes.

       -ss position (input/output)
	   When used as an input option (before "-i"), seeks in this input
	   file to position. Note that in most formats it is not possible to
	   seek exactly, so ffmpeg will seek to the closest seek point before
	   position.  When transcoding and -accurate_seek is enabled (the
	   default), this extra segment between the seek point and position
	   will be decoded and discarded. When doing stream copy or when
	   -noaccurate_seek is used, it will be preserved.

	   When used as an output option (before an output filename), decodes
	   but discards input until the timestamps reach position.

	   position must be a time duration specification, see the Time
	   duration section in the ffmpeg-utils(1) manual.

       -sseof position (input/output)
	   Like the "-ss" option but relative to the "end of file". That is
	   negative values are earlier in the file, 0 is at EOF.

       -itsoffset offset (input)
	   Set the input time offset.

	   offset must be a time duration specification, see the Time duration
	   section in the ffmpeg-utils(1) manual.

	   The offset is added to the timestamps of the input files.
	   Specifying a positive offset means that the corresponding streams
	   are delayed by the time duration specified in offset.

       -timestamp date (output)
	   Set the recording timestamp in the container.

	   date must be a date specification, see the Date section in the
	   ffmpeg-utils(1) manual.

       -metadata[:metadata_specifier] key=value (output,per-metadata)
	   Set a metadata key/value pair.

	   An optional metadata_specifier may be given to set metadata on
	   streams or chapters. See "-map_metadata" documentation for details.

	   This option overrides metadata set with "-map_metadata". It is also
	   possible to delete metadata by using an empty value.

	   For example, for setting the title in the output file:

		   ffmpeg -i in.avi -metadata title="my title" out.flv

	   To set the language of the first audio stream:

		   ffmpeg -i INPUT -metadata:s:a:0 language=eng OUTPUT

       -target type (output)
	   Specify target file type ("vcd", "svcd", "dvd", "dv", "dv50"). type
	   may be prefixed with "pal-", "ntsc-" or "film-" to use the
	   corresponding standard. All the format options (bitrate, codecs,
	   buffer sizes) are then set automatically. You can just type:

		   ffmpeg -i myfile.avi -target vcd /tmp/vcd.mpg

	   Nevertheless you can specify additional options as long as you know
	   they do not conflict with the standard, as in:

		   ffmpeg -i myfile.avi -target vcd -bf 2 /tmp/vcd.mpg

       -dframes number (output)
	   Set the number of data frames to output. This is an alias for
	   "-frames:d".

       -frames[:stream_specifier] framecount (output,per-stream)
	   Stop writing to the stream after framecount frames.

       -q[:stream_specifier] q (output,per-stream)
       -qscale[:stream_specifier] q (output,per-stream)
	   Use fixed quality scale (VBR). The meaning of q/qscale is codec-
	   dependent.  If qscale is used without a stream_specifier then it
	   applies only to the video stream, this is to maintain compatibility
	   with previous behavior and as specifying the same codec specific
	   value to 2 different codecs that is audio and video generally is
	   not what is intended when no stream_specifier is used.

       -filter[:stream_specifier] filtergraph (output,per-stream)
	   Create the filtergraph specified by filtergraph and use it to
	   filter the stream.

	   filtergraph is a description of the filtergraph to apply to the
	   stream, and must have a single input and a single output of the
	   same type of the stream. In the filtergraph, the input is
	   associated to the label "in", and the output to the label "out".
	   See the ffmpeg-filters manual for more information about the
	   filtergraph syntax.

	   See the -filter_complex option if you want to create filtergraphs
	   with multiple inputs and/or outputs.

       -filter_script[:stream_specifier] filename (output,per-stream)
	   This option is similar to -filter, the only difference is that its
	   argument is the name of the file from which a filtergraph
	   description is to be read.

       -pre[:stream_specifier] preset_name (output,per-stream)
	   Specify the preset for matching stream(s).

       -stats (global)
	   Print encoding progress/statistics. It is on by default, to
	   explicitly disable it you need to specify "-nostats".

       -progress url (global)
	   Send program-friendly progress information to url.

	   Progress information is written approximately every second and at
	   the end of the encoding process. It is made of "key=value" lines.
	   key consists of only alphanumeric characters. The last key of a
	   sequence of progress information is always "progress".

       -stdin
	   Enable interaction on standard input. On by default unless standard
	   input is used as an input. To explicitly disable interaction you
	   need to specify "-nostdin".

	   Disabling interaction on standard input is useful, for example, if
	   ffmpeg is in the background process group. Roughly the same result
	   can be achieved with "ffmpeg ... < /dev/null" but it requires a
	   shell.

       -debug_ts (global)
	   Print timestamp information. It is off by default. This option is
	   mostly useful for testing and debugging purposes, and the output
	   format may change from one version to another, so it should not be
	   employed by portable scripts.

	   See also the option "-fdebug ts".

       -attach filename (output)
	   Add an attachment to the output file. This is supported by a few
	   formats like Matroska for e.g. fonts used in rendering subtitles.
	   Attachments are implemented as a specific type of stream, so this
	   option will add a new stream to the file. It is then possible to
	   use per-stream options on this stream in the usual way. Attachment
	   streams created with this option will be created after all the
	   other streams (i.e. those created with "-map" or automatic
	   mappings).

	   Note that for Matroska you also have to set the mimetype metadata
	   tag:

		   ffmpeg -i INPUT -attach DejaVuSans.ttf -metadata:s:2 mimetype=application/x-truetype-font out.mkv

	   (assuming that the attachment stream will be third in the output
	   file).

       -dump_attachment[:stream_specifier] filename (input,per-stream)
	   Extract the matching attachment stream into a file named filename.
	   If filename is empty, then the value of the "filename" metadata tag
	   will be used.

	   E.g. to extract the first attachment to a file named 'out.ttf':

		   ffmpeg -dump_attachment:t:0 out.ttf -i INPUT

	   To extract all attachments to files determined by the "filename"
	   tag:

		   ffmpeg -dump_attachment:t "" -i INPUT

	   Technical note -- attachments are implemented as codec extradata,
	   so this option can actually be used to extract extradata from any
	   stream, not just attachments.

       -noautorotate
	   Disable automatically rotating video based on file metadata.

   Video Options
       -vframes number (output)
	   Set the number of video frames to output. This is an alias for
	   "-frames:v".

       -r[:stream_specifier] fps (input/output,per-stream)
	   Set frame rate (Hz value, fraction or abbreviation).

	   As an input option, ignore any timestamps stored in the file and
	   instead generate timestamps assuming constant frame rate fps.  This
	   is not the same as the -framerate option used for some input
	   formats like image2 or v4l2 (it used to be the same in older
	   versions of FFmpeg).  If in doubt use -framerate instead of the
	   input option -r.

	   As an output option, duplicate or drop input frames to achieve
	   constant output frame rate fps.

       -s[:stream_specifier] size (input/output,per-stream)
	   Set frame size.

	   As an input option, this is a shortcut for the video_size private
	   option, recognized by some demuxers for which the frame size is
	   either not stored in the file or is configurable -- e.g. raw video
	   or video grabbers.

	   As an output option, this inserts the "scale" video filter to the
	   end of the corresponding filtergraph. Please use the "scale" filter
	   directly to insert it at the beginning or some other place.

	   The format is wxh (default - same as source).

       -aspect[:stream_specifier] aspect (output,per-stream)
	   Set the video display aspect ratio specified by aspect.

	   aspect can be a floating point number string, or a string of the
	   form num:den, where num and den are the numerator and denominator
	   of the aspect ratio. For example "4:3", "16:9", "1.3333", and
	   "1.7777" are valid argument values.

	   If used together with -vcodec copy, it will affect the aspect ratio
	   stored at container level, but not the aspect ratio stored in
	   encoded frames, if it exists.

       -vn (output)
	   Disable video recording.

       -vcodec codec (output)
	   Set the video codec. This is an alias for "-codec:v".

       -pass[:stream_specifier] n (output,per-stream)
	   Select the pass number (1 or 2). It is used to do two-pass video
	   encoding. The statistics of the video are recorded in the first
	   pass into a log file (see also the option -passlogfile), and in the
	   second pass that log file is used to generate the video at the
	   exact requested bitrate.  On pass 1, you may just deactivate audio
	   and set output to null, examples for Windows and Unix:

		   ffmpeg -i foo.mov -c:v libxvid -pass 1 -an -f rawvideo -y NUL
		   ffmpeg -i foo.mov -c:v libxvid -pass 1 -an -f rawvideo -y /dev/null

       -passlogfile[:stream_specifier] prefix (output,per-stream)
	   Set two-pass log file name prefix to prefix, the default file name
	   prefix is ``ffmpeg2pass''. The complete file name will be
	   PREFIX-N.log, where N is a number specific to the output stream

       -vf filtergraph (output)
	   Create the filtergraph specified by filtergraph and use it to
	   filter the stream.

	   This is an alias for "-filter:v", see the -filter option.

   Advanced Video options
       -pix_fmt[:stream_specifier] format (input/output,per-stream)
	   Set pixel format. Use "-pix_fmts" to show all the supported pixel
	   formats.  If the selected pixel format can not be selected, ffmpeg
	   will print a warning and select the best pixel format supported by
	   the encoder.  If pix_fmt is prefixed by a "+", ffmpeg will exit
	   with an error if the requested pixel format can not be selected,
	   and automatic conversions inside filtergraphs are disabled.	If
	   pix_fmt is a single "+", ffmpeg selects the same pixel format as
	   the input (or graph output) and automatic conversions are disabled.

       -sws_flags flags (input/output)
	   Set SwScaler flags.

       -vdt n
	   Discard threshold.

       -rc_override[:stream_specifier] override (output,per-stream)
	   Rate control override for specific intervals, formatted as
	   "int,int,int" list separated with slashes. Two first values are the
	   beginning and end frame numbers, last one is quantizer to use if
	   positive, or quality factor if negative.

       -ilme
	   Force interlacing support in encoder (MPEG-2 and MPEG-4 only).  Use
	   this option if your input file is interlaced and you want to keep
	   the interlaced format for minimum losses.  The alternative is to
	   deinterlace the input stream with -deinterlace, but deinterlacing
	   introduces losses.

       -psnr
	   Calculate PSNR of compressed frames.

       -vstats
	   Dump video coding statistics to vstats_HHMMSS.log.

       -vstats_file file
	   Dump video coding statistics to file.

       -top[:stream_specifier] n (output,per-stream)
	   top=1/bottom=0/auto=-1 field first

       -dc precision
	   Intra_dc_precision.

       -vtag fourcc/tag (output)
	   Force video tag/fourcc. This is an alias for "-tag:v".

       -qphist (global)
	   Show QP histogram

       -vbsf bitstream_filter
	   Deprecated see -bsf

       -force_key_frames[:stream_specifier] time[,time...] (output,per-stream)
       -force_key_frames[:stream_specifier] expr:expr (output,per-stream)
	   Force key frames at the specified timestamps, more precisely at the
	   first frames after each specified time.

	   If the argument is prefixed with "expr:", the string expr is
	   interpreted like an expression and is evaluated for each frame. A
	   key frame is forced in case the evaluation is non-zero.

	   If one of the times is ""chapters"[delta]", it is expanded into the
	   time of the beginning of all chapters in the file, shifted by
	   delta, expressed as a time in seconds.  This option can be useful
	   to ensure that a seek point is present at a chapter mark or any
	   other designated place in the output file.

	   For example, to insert a key frame at 5 minutes, plus key frames
	   0.1 second before the beginning of every chapter:

		   -force_key_frames 0:05:00,chapters-0.1

	   The expression in expr can contain the following constants:

	   n   the number of current processed frame, starting from 0

	   n_forced
	       the number of forced frames

	   prev_forced_n
	       the number of the previous forced frame, it is "NAN" when no
	       keyframe was forced yet

	   prev_forced_t
	       the time of the previous forced frame, it is "NAN" when no
	       keyframe was forced yet

	   t   the time of the current processed frame

	   For example to force a key frame every 5 seconds, you can specify:

		   -force_key_frames expr:gte(t,n_forced*5)

	   To force a key frame 5 seconds after the time of the last forced
	   one, starting from second 13:

		   -force_key_frames expr:if(isnan(prev_forced_t),gte(t,13),gte(t,prev_forced_t+5))

	   Note that forcing too many keyframes is very harmful for the
	   lookahead algorithms of certain encoders: using fixed-GOP options
	   or similar would be more efficient.

       -copyinkf[:stream_specifier] (output,per-stream)
	   When doing stream copy, copy also non-key frames found at the
	   beginning.

       -hwaccel[:stream_specifier] hwaccel (input,per-stream)
	   Use hardware acceleration to decode the matching stream(s). The
	   allowed values of hwaccel are:

	   none
	       Do not use any hardware acceleration (the default).

	   auto
	       Automatically select the hardware acceleration method.

	   vda Use Apple VDA hardware acceleration.

	   vdpau
	       Use VDPAU (Video Decode and Presentation API for Unix) hardware
	       acceleration.

	   dxva2
	       Use DXVA2 (DirectX Video Acceleration) hardware acceleration.

	   This option has no effect if the selected hwaccel is not available
	   or not supported by the chosen decoder.

	   Note that most acceleration methods are intended for playback and
	   will not be faster than software decoding on modern CPUs.
	   Additionally, ffmpeg will usually need to copy the decoded frames
	   from the GPU memory into the system memory, resulting in further
	   performance loss. This option is thus mainly useful for testing.

       -hwaccel_device[:stream_specifier] hwaccel_device (input,per-stream)
	   Select a device to use for hardware acceleration.

	   This option only makes sense when the -hwaccel option is also
	   specified. Its exact meaning depends on the specific hardware
	   acceleration method chosen.

	   vdpau
	       For VDPAU, this option specifies the X11 display/screen to use.
	       If this option is not specified, the value of the DISPLAY
	       environment variable is used

	   dxva2
	       For DXVA2, this option should contain the number of the display
	       adapter to use.	If this option is not specified, the default
	       adapter is used.

       -hwaccels
	   List all hardware acceleration methods supported in this build of
	   ffmpeg.

   Audio Options
       -aframes number (output)
	   Set the number of audio frames to output. This is an alias for
	   "-frames:a".

       -ar[:stream_specifier] freq (input/output,per-stream)
	   Set the audio sampling frequency. For output streams it is set by
	   default to the frequency of the corresponding input stream. For
	   input streams this option only makes sense for audio grabbing
	   devices and raw demuxers and is mapped to the corresponding demuxer
	   options.

       -aq q (output)
	   Set the audio quality (codec-specific, VBR). This is an alias for
	   -q:a.

       -ac[:stream_specifier] channels (input/output,per-stream)
	   Set the number of audio channels. For output streams it is set by
	   default to the number of input audio channels. For input streams
	   this option only makes sense for audio grabbing devices and raw
	   demuxers and is mapped to the corresponding demuxer options.

       -an (output)
	   Disable audio recording.

       -acodec codec (input/output)
	   Set the audio codec. This is an alias for "-codec:a".

       -sample_fmt[:stream_specifier] sample_fmt (output,per-stream)
	   Set the audio sample format. Use "-sample_fmts" to get a list of
	   supported sample formats.

       -af filtergraph (output)
	   Create the filtergraph specified by filtergraph and use it to
	   filter the stream.

	   This is an alias for "-filter:a", see the -filter option.

   Advanced Audio options
       -atag fourcc/tag (output)
	   Force audio tag/fourcc. This is an alias for "-tag:a".

       -absf bitstream_filter
	   Deprecated, see -bsf

       -guess_layout_max channels (input,per-stream)
	   If some input channel layout is not known, try to guess only if it
	   corresponds to at most the specified number of channels. For
	   example, 2 tells to ffmpeg to recognize 1 channel as mono and 2
	   channels as stereo but not 6 channels as 5.1. The default is to
	   always try to guess. Use 0 to disable all guessing.

   Subtitle options
       -scodec codec (input/output)
	   Set the subtitle codec. This is an alias for "-codec:s".

       -sn (output)
	   Disable subtitle recording.

       -sbsf bitstream_filter
	   Deprecated, see -bsf

   Advanced Subtitle options
       -fix_sub_duration
	   Fix subtitles durations. For each subtitle, wait for the next
	   packet in the same stream and adjust the duration of the first to
	   avoid overlap. This is necessary with some subtitles codecs,
	   especially DVB subtitles, because the duration in the original
	   packet is only a rough estimate and the end is actually marked by
	   an empty subtitle frame. Failing to use this option when necessary
	   can result in exaggerated durations or muxing failures due to non-
	   monotonic timestamps.

	   Note that this option will delay the output of all data until the
	   next subtitle packet is decoded: it may increase memory consumption
	   and latency a lot.

       -canvas_size size
	   Set the size of the canvas used to render subtitles.

   Advanced options
       -map
       [-]input_file_id[:stream_specifier][,sync_file_id[:stream_specifier]] |
       [linklabel] (output)
	   Designate one or more input streams as a source for the output
	   file. Each input stream is identified by the input file index
	   input_file_id and the input stream index input_stream_id within the
	   input file. Both indices start at 0. If specified,
	   sync_file_id:stream_specifier sets which input stream is used as a
	   presentation sync reference.

	   The first "-map" option on the command line specifies the source
	   for output stream 0, the second "-map" option specifies the source
	   for output stream 1, etc.

	   A "-" character before the stream identifier creates a "negative"
	   mapping.  It disables matching streams from already created
	   mappings.

	   An alternative [linklabel] form will map outputs from complex
	   filter graphs (see the -filter_complex option) to the output file.
	   linklabel must correspond to a defined output link label in the
	   graph.

	   For example, to map ALL streams from the first input file to output

		   ffmpeg -i INPUT -map 0 output

	   For example, if you have two audio streams in the first input file,
	   these streams are identified by "0:0" and "0:1". You can use "-map"
	   to select which streams to place in an output file. For example:

		   ffmpeg -i INPUT -map 0:1 out.wav

	   will map the input stream in INPUT identified by "0:1" to the
	   (single) output stream in out.wav.

	   For example, to select the stream with index 2 from input file
	   a.mov (specified by the identifier "0:2"), and stream with index 6
	   from input b.mov (specified by the identifier "1:6"), and copy them
	   to the output file out.mov:

		   ffmpeg -i a.mov -i b.mov -c copy -map 0:2 -map 1:6 out.mov

	   To select all video and the third audio stream from an input file:

		   ffmpeg -i INPUT -map 0:v -map 0:a:2 OUTPUT

	   To map all the streams except the second audio, use negative
	   mappings

		   ffmpeg -i INPUT -map 0 -map -0:a:1 OUTPUT

	   To pick the English audio stream:

		   ffmpeg -i INPUT -map 0:m:language:eng OUTPUT

	   Note that using this option disables the default mappings for this
	   output file.

       -ignore_unknown
	   Ignore input streams with unknown type instead of failing if
	   copying such streams is attempted.

       -copy_unknown
	   Allow input streams with unknown type to be copied instead of
	   failing if copying such streams is attempted.

       -map_channel
       [input_file_id.stream_specifier.channel_id|-1][:output_file_id.stream_specifier]
	   Map an audio channel from a given input to an output. If
	   output_file_id.stream_specifier is not set, the audio channel will
	   be mapped on all the audio streams.

	   Using "-1" instead of input_file_id.stream_specifier.channel_id
	   will map a muted channel.

	   For example, assuming INPUT is a stereo audio file, you can switch
	   the two audio channels with the following command:

		   ffmpeg -i INPUT -map_channel 0.0.1 -map_channel 0.0.0 OUTPUT

	   If you want to mute the first channel and keep the second:

		   ffmpeg -i INPUT -map_channel -1 -map_channel 0.0.1 OUTPUT

	   The order of the "-map_channel" option specifies the order of the
	   channels in the output stream. The output channel layout is guessed
	   from the number of channels mapped (mono if one "-map_channel",
	   stereo if two, etc.). Using "-ac" in combination of "-map_channel"
	   makes the channel gain levels to be updated if input and output
	   channel layouts don't match (for instance two "-map_channel"
	   options and "-ac 6").

	   You can also extract each channel of an input to specific outputs;
	   the following command extracts two channels of the INPUT audio
	   stream (file 0, stream 0) to the respective OUTPUT_CH0 and
	   OUTPUT_CH1 outputs:

		   ffmpeg -i INPUT -map_channel 0.0.0 OUTPUT_CH0 -map_channel 0.0.1 OUTPUT_CH1

	   The following example splits the channels of a stereo input into
	   two separate streams, which are put into the same output file:

		   ffmpeg -i stereo.wav -map 0:0 -map 0:0 -map_channel 0.0.0:0.0 -map_channel 0.0.1:0.1 -y out.ogg

	   Note that currently each output stream can only contain channels
	   from a single input stream; you can't for example use
	   "-map_channel" to pick multiple input audio channels contained in
	   different streams (from the same or different files) and merge them
	   into a single output stream. It is therefore not currently
	   possible, for example, to turn two separate mono streams into a
	   single stereo stream. However splitting a stereo stream into two
	   single channel mono streams is possible.

	   If you need this feature, a possible workaround is to use the
	   amerge filter. For example, if you need to merge a media (here
	   input.mkv) with 2 mono audio streams into one single stereo channel
	   audio stream (and keep the video stream), you can use the following
	   command:

		   ffmpeg -i input.mkv -filter_complex "[0:1] [0:2] amerge" -c:a pcm_s16le -c:v copy output.mkv

       -map_metadata[:metadata_spec_out] infile[:metadata_spec_in]
       (output,per-metadata)
	   Set metadata information of the next output file from infile. Note
	   that those are file indices (zero-based), not filenames.  Optional
	   metadata_spec_in/out parameters specify, which metadata to copy.  A
	   metadata specifier can have the following forms:

	   g   global metadata, i.e. metadata that applies to the whole file

	   s[:stream_spec]
	       per-stream metadata. stream_spec is a stream specifier as
	       described in the Stream specifiers chapter. In an input
	       metadata specifier, the first matching stream is copied from.
	       In an output metadata specifier, all matching streams are
	       copied to.

	   c:chapter_index
	       per-chapter metadata. chapter_index is the zero-based chapter
	       index.

	   p:program_index
	       per-program metadata. program_index is the zero-based program
	       index.

	   If metadata specifier is omitted, it defaults to global.

	   By default, global metadata is copied from the first input file,
	   per-stream and per-chapter metadata is copied along with
	   streams/chapters. These default mappings are disabled by creating
	   any mapping of the relevant type. A negative file index can be used
	   to create a dummy mapping that just disables automatic copying.

	   For example to copy metadata from the first stream of the input
	   file to global metadata of the output file:

		   ffmpeg -i in.ogg -map_metadata 0:s:0 out.mp3

	   To do the reverse, i.e. copy global metadata to all audio streams:

		   ffmpeg -i in.mkv -map_metadata:s:a 0:g out.mkv

	   Note that simple 0 would work as well in this example, since global
	   metadata is assumed by default.

       -map_chapters input_file_index (output)
	   Copy chapters from input file with index input_file_index to the
	   next output file. If no chapter mapping is specified, then chapters
	   are copied from the first input file with at least one chapter. Use
	   a negative file index to disable any chapter copying.

       -benchmark (global)
	   Show benchmarking information at the end of an encode.  Shows CPU
	   time used and maximum memory consumption.  Maximum memory
	   consumption is not supported on all systems, it will usually
	   display as 0 if not supported.

       -benchmark_all (global)
	   Show benchmarking information during the encode.  Shows CPU time
	   used in various steps (audio/video encode/decode).

       -timelimit duration (global)
	   Exit after ffmpeg has been running for duration seconds.

       -dump (global)
	   Dump each input packet to stderr.

       -hex (global)
	   When dumping packets, also dump the payload.

       -re (input)
	   Read input at native frame rate. Mainly used to simulate a grab
	   device.  or live input stream (e.g. when reading from a file).
	   Should not be used with actual grab devices or live input streams
	   (where it can cause packet loss).  By default ffmpeg attempts to
	   read the input(s) as fast as possible.  This option will slow down
	   the reading of the input(s) to the native frame rate of the
	   input(s). It is useful for real-time output (e.g. live streaming).

       -loop_input
	   Loop over the input stream. Currently it works only for image
	   streams. This option is used for automatic FFserver testing.  This
	   option is deprecated, use -loop 1.

       -loop_output number_of_times
	   Repeatedly loop output for formats that support looping such as
	   animated GIF (0 will loop the output infinitely).  This option is
	   deprecated, use -loop.

       -vsync parameter
	   Video sync method.  For compatibility reasons old values can be
	   specified as numbers.  Newly added values will have to be specified
	   as strings always.

	   0, passthrough
	       Each frame is passed with its timestamp from the demuxer to the
	       muxer.

	   1, cfr
	       Frames will be duplicated and dropped to achieve exactly the
	       requested constant frame rate.

	   2, vfr
	       Frames are passed through with their timestamp or dropped so as
	       to prevent 2 frames from having the same timestamp.

	   drop
	       As passthrough but destroys all timestamps, making the muxer
	       generate fresh timestamps based on frame-rate.

	   -1, auto
	       Chooses between 1 and 2 depending on muxer capabilities. This
	       is the default method.

	   Note that the timestamps may be further modified by the muxer,
	   after this.	For example, in the case that the format option
	   avoid_negative_ts is enabled.

	   With -map you can select from which stream the timestamps should be
	   taken. You can leave either video or audio unchanged and sync the
	   remaining stream(s) to the unchanged one.

       -frame_drop_threshold parameter
	   Frame drop threshold, which specifies how much behind video frames
	   can be before they are dropped. In frame rate units, so 1.0 is one
	   frame.  The default is -1.1. One possible usecase is to avoid
	   framedrops in case of noisy timestamps or to increase frame drop
	   precision in case of exact timestamps.

       -async samples_per_second
	   Audio sync method. "Stretches/squeezes" the audio stream to match
	   the timestamps, the parameter is the maximum samples per second by
	   which the audio is changed.	-async 1 is a special case where only
	   the start of the audio stream is corrected without any later
	   correction.

	   Note that the timestamps may be further modified by the muxer,
	   after this.	For example, in the case that the format option
	   avoid_negative_ts is enabled.

	   This option has been deprecated. Use the "aresample" audio filter
	   instead.

       -copyts
	   Do not process input timestamps, but keep their values without
	   trying to sanitize them. In particular, do not remove the initial
	   start time offset value.

	   Note that, depending on the vsync option or on specific muxer
	   processing (e.g. in case the format option avoid_negative_ts is
	   enabled) the output timestamps may mismatch with the input
	   timestamps even when this option is selected.

       -start_at_zero
	   When used with copyts, shift input timestamps so they start at
	   zero.

	   This means that using e.g. "-ss 50" will make output timestamps
	   start at 50 seconds, regardless of what timestamp the input file
	   started at.

       -copytb mode
	   Specify how to set the encoder timebase when stream copying.  mode
	   is an integer numeric value, and can assume one of the following
	   values:

	   1   Use the demuxer timebase.

	       The time base is copied to the output encoder from the
	       corresponding input demuxer. This is sometimes required to
	       avoid non monotonically increasing timestamps when copying
	       video streams with variable frame rate.

	   0   Use the decoder timebase.

	       The time base is copied to the output encoder from the
	       corresponding input decoder.

	   -1  Try to make the choice automatically, in order to generate a
	       sane output.

	   Default value is -1.

       -shortest (output)
	   Finish encoding when the shortest input stream ends.

       -dts_delta_threshold
	   Timestamp discontinuity delta threshold.

       -muxdelay seconds (input)
	   Set the maximum demux-decode delay.

       -muxpreload seconds (input)
	   Set the initial demux-decode delay.

       -streamid output-stream-index:new-value (output)
	   Assign a new stream-id value to an output stream. This option
	   should be specified prior to the output filename to which it
	   applies.  For the situation where multiple output files exist, a
	   streamid may be reassigned to a different value.

	   For example, to set the stream 0 PID to 33 and the stream 1 PID to
	   36 for an output mpegts file:

		   ffmpeg -i infile -streamid 0:33 -streamid 1:36 out.ts

       -bsf[:stream_specifier] bitstream_filters (output,per-stream)
	   Set bitstream filters for matching streams. bitstream_filters is a
	   comma-separated list of bitstream filters. Use the "-bsfs" option
	   to get the list of bitstream filters.

		   ffmpeg -i h264.mp4 -c:v copy -bsf:v h264_mp4toannexb -an out.h264

		   ffmpeg -i file.mov -an -vn -bsf:s mov2textsub -c:s copy -f rawvideo sub.txt

       -tag[:stream_specifier] codec_tag (input/output,per-stream)
	   Force a tag/fourcc for matching streams.

       -timecode hh:mm:ssSEPff
	   Specify Timecode for writing. SEP is ':' for non drop timecode and
	   ';' (or '.') for drop.

		   ffmpeg -i input.mpg -timecode 01:02:03.04 -r 30000/1001 -s ntsc output.mpg

       -filter_complex filtergraph (global)
	   Define a complex filtergraph, i.e. one with arbitrary number of
	   inputs and/or outputs. For simple graphs -- those with one input
	   and one output of the same type -- see the -filter options.
	   filtergraph is a description of the filtergraph, as described in
	   the ``Filtergraph syntax'' section of the ffmpeg-filters manual.

	   Input link labels must refer to input streams using the
	   "[file_index:stream_specifier]" syntax (i.e. the same as -map
	   uses). If stream_specifier matches multiple streams, the first one
	   will be used. An unlabeled input will be connected to the first
	   unused input stream of the matching type.

	   Output link labels are referred to with -map. Unlabeled outputs are
	   added to the first output file.

	   Note that with this option it is possible to use only lavfi sources
	   without normal input files.

	   For example, to overlay an image over video

		   ffmpeg -i video.mkv -i image.png -filter_complex '[0:v][1:v]overlay[out]' -map
		   '[out]' out.mkv

	   Here "[0:v]" refers to the first video stream in the first input
	   file, which is linked to the first (main) input of the overlay
	   filter. Similarly the first video stream in the second input is
	   linked to the second (overlay) input of overlay.

	   Assuming there is only one video stream in each input file, we can
	   omit input labels, so the above is equivalent to

		   ffmpeg -i video.mkv -i image.png -filter_complex 'overlay[out]' -map
		   '[out]' out.mkv

	   Furthermore we can omit the output label and the single output from
	   the filter graph will be added to the output file automatically, so
	   we can simply write

		   ffmpeg -i video.mkv -i image.png -filter_complex 'overlay' out.mkv

	   To generate 5 seconds of pure red video using lavfi "color" source:

		   ffmpeg -filter_complex 'color=c=red' -t 5 out.mkv

       -lavfi filtergraph (global)
	   Define a complex filtergraph, i.e. one with arbitrary number of
	   inputs and/or outputs. Equivalent to -filter_complex.

       -filter_complex_script filename (global)
	   This option is similar to -filter_complex, the only difference is
	   that its argument is the name of the file from which a complex
	   filtergraph description is to be read.

       -accurate_seek (input)
	   This option enables or disables accurate seeking in input files
	   with the -ss option. It is enabled by default, so seeking is
	   accurate when transcoding. Use -noaccurate_seek to disable it,
	   which may be useful e.g. when copying some streams and transcoding
	   the others.

       -seek_timestamp (input)
	   This option enables or disables seeking by timestamp in input files
	   with the -ss option. It is disabled by default. If enabled, the
	   argument to the -ss option is considered an actual timestamp, and
	   is not offset by the start time of the file. This matters only for
	   files which do not start from timestamp 0, such as transport
	   streams.

       -thread_queue_size size (input)
	   This option sets the maximum number of queued packets when reading
	   from the file or device. With low latency / high rate live streams,
	   packets may be discarded if they are not read in a timely manner;
	   raising this value can avoid it.

       -override_ffserver (global)
	   Overrides the input specifications from ffserver. Using this option
	   you can map any input stream to ffserver and control many aspects
	   of the encoding from ffmpeg. Without this option ffmpeg will
	   transmit to ffserver what is requested by ffserver.

	   The option is intended for cases where features are needed that
	   cannot be specified to ffserver but can be to ffmpeg.

       -sdp_file file (global)
	   Print sdp information to file.  This allows dumping sdp information
	   when at least one output isn't an rtp stream.

       -discard (input)
	   Allows discarding specific streams or frames of streams at the
	   demuxer.  Not all demuxers support this.

	   none
	       Discard no frame.

	   default
	       Default, which discards no frames.

	   noref
	       Discard all non-reference frames.

	   bidir
	       Discard all bidirectional frames.

	   nokey
	       Discard all frames excepts keyframes.

	   all Discard all frames.

       -xerror (global)
	   Stop and exit on error

       As a special exception, you can use a bitmap subtitle stream as input:
       it will be converted into a video with the same size as the largest
       video in the file, or 720x576 if no video is present. Note that this is
       an experimental and temporary solution. It will be removed once
       libavfilter has proper support for subtitles.

       For example, to hardcode subtitles on top of a DVB-T recording stored
       in MPEG-TS format, delaying the subtitles by 1 second:

	       ffmpeg -i input.ts -filter_complex \
		 '[#0x2ef] setpts=PTS+1/TB [sub] ; [#0x2d0] [sub] overlay' \
		 -sn -map '#0x2dc' output.mkv

       (0x2d0, 0x2dc and 0x2ef are the MPEG-TS PIDs of respectively the video,
       audio and subtitles streams; 0:0, 0:3 and 0:7 would have worked too)

   Preset files
       A preset file contains a sequence of option=value pairs, one for each
       line, specifying a sequence of options which would be awkward to
       specify on the command line. Lines starting with the hash ('#')
       character are ignored and are used to provide comments. Check the
       presets directory in the FFmpeg source tree for examples.

       There are two types of preset files: ffpreset and avpreset files.

       ffpreset files

       ffpreset files are specified with the "vpre", "apre", "spre", and
       "fpre" options. The "fpre" option takes the filename of the preset
       instead of a preset name as input and can be used for any kind of
       codec. For the "vpre", "apre", and "spre" options, the options
       specified in a preset file are applied to the currently selected codec
       of the same type as the preset option.

       The argument passed to the "vpre", "apre", and "spre" preset options
       identifies the preset file to use according to the following rules:

       First ffmpeg searches for a file named arg.ffpreset in the directories
       $FFMPEG_DATADIR (if set), and $HOME/.ffmpeg, and in the datadir defined
       at configuration time (usually PREFIX/share/ffmpeg) or in a ffpresets
       folder along the executable on win32, in that order. For example, if
       the argument is "libvpx-1080p", it will search for the file
       libvpx-1080p.ffpreset.

       If no such file is found, then ffmpeg will search for a file named
       codec_name-arg.ffpreset in the above-mentioned directories, where
       codec_name is the name of the codec to which the preset file options
       will be applied. For example, if you select the video codec with
       "-vcodec libvpx" and use "-vpre 1080p", then it will search for the
       file libvpx-1080p.ffpreset.

       avpreset files

       avpreset files are specified with the "pre" option. They work similar
       to ffpreset files, but they only allow encoder- specific options.
       Therefore, an option=value pair specifying an encoder cannot be used.

       When the "pre" option is specified, ffmpeg will look for files with the
       suffix .avpreset in the directories $AVCONV_DATADIR (if set), and
       $HOME/.avconv, and in the datadir defined at configuration time
       (usually PREFIX/share/ffmpeg), in that order.

       First ffmpeg searches for a file named codec_name-arg.avpreset in the
       above-mentioned directories, where codec_name is the name of the codec
       to which the preset file options will be applied. For example, if you
       select the video codec with "-vcodec libvpx" and use "-pre 1080p", then
       it will search for the file libvpx-1080p.avpreset.

       If no such file is found, then ffmpeg will search for a file named
       arg.avpreset in the same directories.

EXAMPLES
   Video and Audio grabbing
       If you specify the input format and device then ffmpeg can grab video
       and audio directly.

	       ffmpeg -f oss -i /dev/dsp -f video4linux2 -i /dev/video0 /tmp/out.mpg

       Or with an ALSA audio source (mono input, card id 1) instead of OSS:

	       ffmpeg -f alsa -ac 1 -i hw:1 -f video4linux2 -i /dev/video0 /tmp/out.mpg

       Note that you must activate the right video source and channel before
       launching ffmpeg with any TV viewer such as
       <http://linux.bytesex.org/xawtv/> by Gerd Knorr. You also have to set
       the audio recording levels correctly with a standard mixer.

   X11 grabbing
       Grab the X11 display with ffmpeg via

	       ffmpeg -f x11grab -video_size cif -framerate 25 -i :0.0 /tmp/out.mpg

       0.0 is display.screen number of your X11 server, same as the DISPLAY
       environment variable.

	       ffmpeg -f x11grab -video_size cif -framerate 25 -i :0.0+10,20 /tmp/out.mpg

       0.0 is display.screen number of your X11 server, same as the DISPLAY
       environment variable. 10 is the x-offset and 20 the y-offset for the
       grabbing.

   Video and Audio file format conversion
       Any supported file format and protocol can serve as input to ffmpeg:

       Examples:

       ·   You can use YUV files as input:

		   ffmpeg -i /tmp/test%d.Y /tmp/out.mpg

	   It will use the files:

		   /tmp/test0.Y, /tmp/test0.U, /tmp/test0.V,
		   /tmp/test1.Y, /tmp/test1.U, /tmp/test1.V, etc...

	   The Y files use twice the resolution of the U and V files. They are
	   raw files, without header. They can be generated by all decent
	   video decoders. You must specify the size of the image with the -s
	   option if ffmpeg cannot guess it.

       ·   You can input from a raw YUV420P file:

		   ffmpeg -i /tmp/test.yuv /tmp/out.avi

	   test.yuv is a file containing raw YUV planar data. Each frame is
	   composed of the Y plane followed by the U and V planes at half
	   vertical and horizontal resolution.

       ·   You can output to a raw YUV420P file:

		   ffmpeg -i mydivx.avi hugefile.yuv

       ·   You can set several input files and output files:

		   ffmpeg -i /tmp/a.wav -s 640x480 -i /tmp/a.yuv /tmp/a.mpg

	   Converts the audio file a.wav and the raw YUV video file a.yuv to
	   MPEG file a.mpg.

       ·   You can also do audio and video conversions at the same time:

		   ffmpeg -i /tmp/a.wav -ar 22050 /tmp/a.mp2

	   Converts a.wav to MPEG audio at 22050 Hz sample rate.

       ·   You can encode to several formats at the same time and define a
	   mapping from input stream to output streams:

		   ffmpeg -i /tmp/a.wav -map 0:a -b:a 64k /tmp/a.mp2 -map 0:a -b:a 128k /tmp/b.mp2

	   Converts a.wav to a.mp2 at 64 kbits and to b.mp2 at 128 kbits.
	   '-map file:index' specifies which input stream is used for each
	   output stream, in the order of the definition of output streams.

       ·   You can transcode decrypted VOBs:

		   ffmpeg -i snatch_1.vob -f avi -c:v mpeg4 -b:v 800k -g 300 -bf 2 -c:a libmp3lame -b:a 128k snatch.avi

	   This is a typical DVD ripping example; the input is a VOB file, the
	   output an AVI file with MPEG-4 video and MP3 audio. Note that in
	   this command we use B-frames so the MPEG-4 stream is DivX5
	   compatible, and GOP size is 300 which means one intra frame every
	   10 seconds for 29.97fps input video. Furthermore, the audio stream
	   is MP3-encoded so you need to enable LAME support by passing
	   "--enable-libmp3lame" to configure.	The mapping is particularly
	   useful for DVD transcoding to get the desired audio language.

	   NOTE: To see the supported input formats, use "ffmpeg -formats".

       ·   You can extract images from a video, or create a video from many
	   images:

	   For extracting images from a video:

		   ffmpeg -i foo.avi -r 1 -s WxH -f image2 foo-%03d.jpeg

	   This will extract one video frame per second from the video and
	   will output them in files named foo-001.jpeg, foo-002.jpeg, etc.
	   Images will be rescaled to fit the new WxH values.

	   If you want to extract just a limited number of frames, you can use
	   the above command in combination with the -vframes or -t option, or
	   in combination with -ss to start extracting from a certain point in
	   time.

	   For creating a video from many images:

		   ffmpeg -f image2 -framerate 12 -i foo-%03d.jpeg -s WxH foo.avi

	   The syntax "foo-%03d.jpeg" specifies to use a decimal number
	   composed of three digits padded with zeroes to express the sequence
	   number. It is the same syntax supported by the C printf function,
	   but only formats accepting a normal integer are suitable.

	   When importing an image sequence, -i also supports expanding shell-
	   like wildcard patterns (globbing) internally, by selecting the
	   image2-specific "-pattern_type glob" option.

	   For example, for creating a video from filenames matching the glob
	   pattern "foo-*.jpeg":

		   ffmpeg -f image2 -pattern_type glob -framerate 12 -i 'foo-*.jpeg' -s WxH foo.avi

       ·   You can put many streams of the same type in the output:

		   ffmpeg -i test1.avi -i test2.avi -map 1:1 -map 1:0 -map 0:1 -map 0:0 -c copy -y test12.nut

	   The resulting output file test12.nut will contain the first four
	   streams from the input files in reverse order.

       ·   To force CBR video output:

		   ffmpeg -i myfile.avi -b 4000k -minrate 4000k -maxrate 4000k -bufsize 1835k out.m2v

       ·   The four options lmin, lmax, mblmin and mblmax use 'lambda' units,
	   but you may use the QP2LAMBDA constant to easily convert from 'q'
	   units:

		   ffmpeg -i src.ext -lmax 21*QP2LAMBDA dst.ext
