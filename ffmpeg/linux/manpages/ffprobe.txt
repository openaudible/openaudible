NAME
       ffprobe - ffprobe media prober

SYNOPSIS
       ffprobe [options] [input_file]

DESCRIPTION
       ffprobe gathers information from multimedia streams and prints it in
       human- and machine-readable fashion.

       For example it can be used to check the format of the container used by
       a multimedia stream and the format and type of each media stream
       contained in it.

       If a filename is specified in input, ffprobe will try to open and probe
       the file content. If the file cannot be opened or recognized as a
       multimedia file, a positive exit code is returned.

       ffprobe may be employed both as a standalone application or in
       combination with a textual filter, which may perform more sophisticated
       processing, e.g. statistical processing or plotting.

       Options are used to list some of the formats supported by ffprobe or
       for specifying which information to display, and for setting how
       ffprobe will show it.

       ffprobe output is designed to be easily parsable by a textual filter,
       and consists of one or more sections of a form defined by the selected
       writer, which is specified by the print_format option.

       Sections may contain other nested sections, and are identified by a
       name (which may be shared by other sections), and an unique name. See
       the output of sections.

       Metadata tags stored in the container or in the streams are recognized
       and printed in the corresponding "FORMAT", "STREAM" or "PROGRAM_STREAM"
       section.

OPTIONS
       All the numerical options, if not specified otherwise, accept a string
       representing a number as input, which may be followed by one of the SI
       unit prefixes, for example: 'K', 'M', or 'G'.

       If 'i' is appended to the SI unit prefix, the complete prefix will be
       interpreted as a unit prefix for binary multiples, which are based on
       powers of 1024 instead of powers of 1000. Appending 'B' to the SI unit
       prefix multiplies the value by 8. This allows using, for example: 'KB',
       'MiB', 'G' and 'B' as number suffixes.

       Options which do not take arguments are boolean options, and set the
       corresponding value to true. They can be set to false by prefixing the
       option name with "no". For example using "-nofoo" will set the boolean
       option with name "foo" to false.

   Stream specifiers
       Some options are applied per-stream, e.g. bitrate or codec. Stream
       specifiers are used to precisely specify which stream(s) a given option
       belongs to.

       A stream specifier is a string generally appended to the option name
       and separated from it by a colon. E.g. "-codec:a:1 ac3" contains the
       "a:1" stream specifier, which matches the second audio stream.
       Therefore, it would select the ac3 codec for the second audio stream.

       A stream specifier can match several streams, so that the option is
       applied to all of them. E.g. the stream specifier in "-b:a 128k"
       matches all audio streams.

       An empty stream specifier matches all streams. For example, "-codec
       copy" or "-codec: copy" would copy all the streams without reencoding.

       Possible forms of stream specifiers are:

       stream_index
	   Matches the stream with this index. E.g. "-threads:1 4" would set
	   the thread count for the second stream to 4.

       stream_type[:stream_index]
	   stream_type is one of following: 'v' or 'V' for video, 'a' for
	   audio, 's' for subtitle, 'd' for data, and 't' for attachments. 'v'
	   matches all video streams, 'V' only matches video streams which are
	   not attached pictures, video thumbnails or cover arts.  If
	   stream_index is given, then it matches stream number stream_index
	   of this type. Otherwise, it matches all streams of this type.

       p:program_id[:stream_index]
	   If stream_index is given, then it matches the stream with number
	   stream_index in the program with the id program_id. Otherwise, it
	   matches all streams in the program.

       #stream_id or i:stream_id
	   Match the stream by stream id (e.g. PID in MPEG-TS container).

       m:key[:value]
	   Matches streams with the metadata tag key having the specified
	   value. If value is not given, matches streams that contain the
	   given tag with any value.

       u   Matches streams with usable configuration, the codec must be
	   defined and the essential information such as video dimension or
	   audio sample rate must be present.

	   Note that in ffmpeg, matching by metadata will only work properly
	   for input files.

   Generic options
       These options are shared amongst the ff* tools.

       -L  Show license.

       -h, -?, -help, --help [arg]
	   Show help. An optional parameter may be specified to print help
	   about a specific item. If no argument is specified, only basic (non
	   advanced) tool options are shown.

	   Possible values of arg are:

	   long
	       Print advanced tool options in addition to the basic tool
	       options.

	   Note that the term 'codec' is used throughout this documentation as
	   a shortcut for what is more correctly called a media bitstream
	   format.

       -decoders
	   Show available decoders.

       -encoders
	   Show all available encoders.

       -bsfs

	   Show available sample formats.

       -layouts
	   Show channel names and standard channel layouts.

       -colors
	   Show recognized color names.

       -sources device[,opt1=val1[,opt2=val2]...]
	   Show autodetected sources of the intput device.  Some devices may
	   provide system-dependent source names that cannot be autodetected.
	   The returned list cannot be assumed to be always complete.

		   ffmpeg -sources pulse,server=192.168.0.4

       -sinks device[,opt1=val1[,opt2=val2]...]
	   Show autodetected sinks of the output device.  Some devices may
	   provide system-dependent sink names that cannot be autodetected.
	   The returned list cannot be assumed to be always complete.

		   ffmpeg -sinks pulse,server=192.168.0.4

       -loglevel [repeat+]loglevel | -v [repeat+]loglevel
	   Set the logging level used by the library.  Adding "repeat+"
	   indicates that repeated log output should not be compressed to the
	   first line and the "Last message repeated n times" line will be
	   omitted. "repeat" can also be used alone.  If "repeat" is used
	   alone, and with no prior loglevel set, the default loglevel will be
	   used. If multiple loglevel parameters are given, using 'repeat'
	   will not change the loglevel.  loglevel is a string or a number
	   containing one of the following values:

	   quiet, -8
	       Show nothing at all; be silent.

	   panic, 0
	       Only show fatal errors which could lead the process to crash,
	       such as and assert failure. This is not currently used for
	       anything.

	   fatal, 8
	       Only show fatal errors. These are errors after which the
	       process absolutely cannot continue after.

	   error, 16
	       Show all errors, including ones which can be recovered from.

	   warning, 24
	       Show all warnings and errors. Any message related to possibly
	       incorrect or unexpected events will be shown.

	   info, 32
	       Show informative messages during processing. This is in
	       addition to warnings and errors. This is the default value.

	   verbose, 40
	       Same as "info", except more verbose.

	   debug, 48
	       Show everything, including debugging information.

	   trace, 56

	   By default the program logs to stderr, if coloring is supported by
	   the terminal, colors are used to mark errors and warnings. Log
	   coloring can be disabled setting the environment variable
	   AV_LOG_FORCE_NOCOLOR or NO_COLOR, or can be forced setting the
	   environment variable AV_LOG_FORCE_COLOR.  The use of the
	   environment variable NO_COLOR is deprecated and will be dropped in
	   a following FFmpeg version.

       -report
	   Dump full command line and console output to a file named
	   "program-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.log" in the current directory.  This file
	   can be useful for bug reports.  It also implies "-loglevel
	   verbose".

	   Setting the environment variable FFREPORT to any value has the same
	   effect. If the value is a ':'-separated key=value sequence, these
	   options will affect the report; option values must be escaped if
	   they contain special characters or the options delimiter ':' (see
	   the ``Quoting and escaping'' section in the ffmpeg-utils manual).

	   The following options are recognized:

	   file
	       set the file name to use for the report; %p is expanded to the
	       name of the program, %t is expanded to a timestamp, "%%" is
	       expanded to a plain "%"

	   level
	       set the log verbosity level using a numerical value (see
	       "-loglevel").

	   For example, to output a report to a file named ffreport.log using
	   a log level of 32 (alias for log level "info"):

		   FFREPORT=file=ffreport.log:level=32 ffmpeg -i input output

	   Errors in parsing the environment variable are not fatal, and will
	   not appear in the report.

       -hide_banner
	   Suppress printing banner.

	   All FFmpeg tools will normally show a copyright notice, build
	   options and library versions. This option can be used to suppress
	   printing this information.

       -cpuflags flags (global)
	   Allows setting and clearing cpu flags. This option is intended for
	   testing. Do not use it unless you know what you're doing.

		   ffmpeg -cpuflags -sse+mmx ...
		   ffmpeg -cpuflags mmx ...
		   ffmpeg -cpuflags 0 ...

	   Possible flags for this option are:

	   x86

       -opencl_bench
	   This option is used to benchmark all available OpenCL devices and
	   print the results. This option is only available when FFmpeg has
	   been compiled with "--enable-opencl".

	   When FFmpeg is configured with "--enable-opencl", the options for
	   the global OpenCL context are set via -opencl_options. See the
	   "OpenCL Options" section in the ffmpeg-utils manual for the
	   complete list of supported options. Amongst others, these options
	   include the ability to select a specific platform and device to run
	   the OpenCL code on. By default, FFmpeg will run on the first device
	   of the first platform. While the options for the global OpenCL
	   context provide flexibility to the user in selecting the OpenCL
	   device of their choice, most users would probably want to select
	   the fastest OpenCL device for their system.

	   This option assists the selection of the most efficient
	   configuration by identifying the appropriate device for the user's
	   system. The built-in benchmark is run on all the OpenCL devices and
	   the performance is measured for each device. The devices in the
	   results list are sorted based on their performance with the fastest
	   device listed first. The user can subsequently invoke ffmpeg using
	   the device deemed most appropriate via -opencl_options to obtain
	   the best performance for the OpenCL accelerated code.

	   Typical usage to use the fastest OpenCL device involve the
	   following steps.

	   Run the command:

		   ffmpeg -opencl_bench

	   Note down the platform ID (pidx) and device ID (didx) of the first
	   i.e. fastest device in the list.  Select the platform and device
	   using the command:

		   ffmpeg -opencl_options platform_idx=<pidx>:device_idx=<didx> ...

       -opencl_options options (global)
	   Set OpenCL environment options. This option is only available when
	   FFmpeg has been compiled with "--enable-opencl".

	   options must be a list of key=value option pairs separated by ':'.
	   See the ``OpenCL Options'' section in the ffmpeg-utils manual for
	   the list of supported options.

   AVOptions
       These options are provided directly by the libavformat, libavdevice and
       libavcodec libraries. To see the list of available AVOptions, use the
       -help option. They are separated into two categories:

       generic
	   These options can be set for any container, codec or device.
	   Generic options are listed under AVFormatContext options for
	   containers/devices and under AVCodecContext options for codecs.

       private
	   These options are specific to the given container, device or codec.
	   Private options are listed under their corresponding
	   containers/devices/codecs.

       For example to write an ID3v2.3 header instead of a default ID3v2.4 to
       an MP3 file, use the id3v2_version private option of the MP3 muxer:

	       ffmpeg -i input.flac -id3v2_version 3 out.mp3

       All codec AVOptions are per-stream, and thus a stream specifier should
       be attached to them.

       Note: the -nooption syntax cannot be used for boolean AVOptions, use
       -option 0/-option 1.

       Note: the old undocumented way of specifying per-stream AVOptions by
       prepending v/a/s to the options name is now obsolete and will be
       removed soon.

   Main options
       -f format
	   Force format to use.

       -unit
	   Show the unit of the displayed values.

       -prefix
	   Use SI prefixes for the displayed values.  Unless the
	   "-byte_binary_prefix" option is used all the prefixes are decimal.

       -byte_binary_prefix
	   Force the use of binary prefixes for byte values.

       -sexagesimal
	   Use sexagesimal format HH:MM:SS.MICROSECONDS for time values.

       -pretty
	   Prettify the format of the displayed values, it corresponds to the
	   options "-unit -prefix -byte_binary_prefix -sexagesimal".

       -of, -print_format writer_name[=writer_options]
	   Set the output printing format.

	   writer_name specifies the name of the writer, and writer_options
	   specifies the options to be passed to the writer.

	   For example for printing the output in JSON format, specify:

		   -print_format json

	   For more details on the available output printing formats, see the
	   Writers section below.

       -sections
	   Print sections structure and section information, and exit. The
	   output is not meant to be parsed by a machine.

       -select_streams stream_specifier
	   Select only the streams specified by stream_specifier. This option
	   affects only the options related to streams (e.g. "show_streams",
	   "show_packets", etc.).

	   For example to show only audio streams, you can use the command:

		   ffprobe -show_streams -select_streams a INPUT

	   To show only video packets belonging to the video stream with index
	   1:

		   ffprobe -show_packets -select_streams v:1 INPUT

       -show_data
	   Show payload data, as a hexadecimal and ASCII dump. Coupled with
	   -show_packets, it will dump the packets' data. Coupled with
	   -show_streams, it will dump the codec extradata.

	   The dump is printed as the "data" field. It may contain newlines.

       -show_data_hash algorithm
	   Show a hash of payload data, for packets with -show_packets and for
	   codec extradata with -show_streams.

       -show_error
	   Show information about the error found when trying to probe the
	   input.

	   The error information is printed within a section with name
	   "ERROR".

       -show_format
	   Show information about the container format of the input multimedia
	   stream.

	   All the container format information is printed within a section
	   with name "FORMAT".

       -show_format_entry name
	   Like -show_format, but only prints the specified entry of the
	   container format information, rather than all. This option may be
	   given more than once, then all specified entries will be shown.

	   This option is deprecated, use "show_entries" instead.

       -show_entries section_entries
	   Set list of entries to show.

	   Entries are specified according to the following syntax.
	   section_entries contains a list of section entries separated by
	   ":". Each section entry is composed by a section name (or unique
	   name), optionally followed by a list of entries local to that
	   section, separated by ",".

	   If section name is specified but is followed by no "=", all entries
	   are printed to output, together with all the contained sections.
	   Otherwise only the entries specified in the local section entries
	   list are printed. In particular, if "=" is specified but the list
	   of local entries is empty, then no entries will be shown for that
	   section.

	   Note that the order of specification of the local section entries
	   is not honored in the output, and the usual display order will be
	   retained.

	   The formal syntax is given by:

		   <LOCAL_SECTION_ENTRIES> ::= <SECTION_ENTRY_NAME>[,<LOCAL_SECTION_ENTRIES>]
		   <SECTION_ENTRY>	   ::= <SECTION_NAME>[=[<LOCAL_SECTION_ENTRIES>]]
		   <SECTION_ENTRIES>	   ::= <SECTION_ENTRY>[:<SECTION_ENTRIES>]

	   For example, to show only the index and type of each stream, and
	   the PTS time, duration time, and stream index of the packets, you
	   can specify the argument:

		   packet=pts_time,duration_time,stream_index : stream=index,codec_type

	   To show all the entries in the section "format", but only the codec
	   type in the section "stream", specify the argument:

		   format : stream=codec_type

	   To show all the tags in the stream and format sections:

		   stream_tags : format_tags

	   To show only the "title" tag (if available) in the stream sections:

		   stream_tags=title

       -show_packets
	   Show information about each packet contained in the input
	   multimedia stream.

	   The information for each single packet is printed within a
	   dedicated section with name "PACKET".

       -show_frames
	   Show information about each frame and subtitle contained in the
	   input multimedia stream.

	   The information for each single frame is printed within a dedicated
	   section with name "FRAME" or "SUBTITLE".

       -show_streams
	   Show information about each media stream contained in the input
	   multimedia stream.

	   Each media stream information is printed within a dedicated section
	   with name "STREAM".

       -show_programs
	   Show information about programs and their streams contained in the
	   input multimedia stream.

	   Each media stream information is printed within a dedicated section
	   with name "PROGRAM_STREAM".

       -show_chapters
	   Show information about chapters stored in the format.

	   Each chapter is printed within a dedicated section with name
	   "CHAPTER".

       -count_frames
	   Count the number of frames per stream and report it in the
	   corresponding stream section.

       -count_packets
	   Count the number of packets per stream and report it in the
	   corresponding stream section.

       -read_intervals read_intervals
	   Read only the specified intervals. read_intervals must be a
	   sequence of interval specifications separated by ",".  ffprobe will
	   seek to the interval starting point, and will continue reading from
	   that.

	   Each interval is specified by two optional parts, separated by "%".

	   The first part specifies the interval start position. It is
	   interpreted as an abolute position, or as a relative offset from
	   the current position if it is preceded by the "+" character. If
	   this first part is not specified, no seeking will be performed when
	   reading this interval.

	   The second part specifies the interval end position. It is
	   interpreted as an absolute position, or as a relative offset from
	   the current position if it is preceded by the "+" character. If the
	   offset specification starts with "#", it is interpreted as the
	   number of packets to read (not including the flushing packets) from
	   the interval start. If no second part is specified, the program
	   will read until the end of the input.

	   Note that seeking is not accurate, thus the actual interval start
	   point may be different from the specified position. Also, when an
	   interval duration is specified, the absolute end time will be
	   computed by adding the duration to the interval start point found
	   by seeking the file, rather than to the specified start value.

	   The formal syntax is given by:

		   <INTERVAL>  ::= [<START>|+<START_OFFSET>][%[<END>|+<END_OFFSET>]]
		   <INTERVALS> ::= <INTERVAL>[,<INTERVALS>]

	   A few examples follow.

	   ·   Seek to time 10, read packets until 20 seconds after the found
	       seek point, then seek to position "01:30" (1 minute and thirty
	       seconds) and read packets until position "01:45".

		       10%+20,01:30%01:45

	   ·   Read only 42 packets after seeking to position "01:23":

		       01:23%+#42

	   ·   Read only the first 20 seconds from the start:

		       %+20

	   ·   Read from the start until position "02:30":

		       %02:30

       -show_private_data, -private
	   Show private data, that is data depending on the format of the
	   particular shown element.  This option is enabled by default, but
	   you may need to disable it for specific uses, for example when
	   creating XSD-compliant XML output.

       -show_program_version
	   Show information related to program version.

	   Version information is printed within a section with name
	   "PROGRAM_VERSION".

       -show_library_versions
	   Show information related to library versions.

	   Version information for each library is printed within a section
	   with name "LIBRARY_VERSION".

       -show_versions
	   Show information related to program and library versions. This is
	   the equivalent of setting both -show_program_version and
	   -show_library_versions options.

       -show_pixel_formats
	   Show information about all pixel formats supported by FFmpeg.

	   Pixel format information for each format is printed within a
	   section with name "PIXEL_FORMAT".

       -bitexact
	   Force bitexact output, useful to produce output which is not
	   dependent on the specific build.

       -i input_file
	   Read input_file.

WRITERS
       A writer defines the output format adopted by ffprobe, and will be used
       for printing all the parts of the output.

       A writer may accept one or more arguments, which specify the options to
       adopt. The options are specified as a list of key=value pairs,
       separated by ":".

       All writers support the following options:

       string_validation, sv
	   Set string validation mode.

	   The following values are accepted.

	   fail
	       The writer will fail immediately in case an invalid string
	       (UTF-8) sequence or code point is found in the input. This is
	       especially useful to validate input metadata.

	   ignore
	       Any validation error will be ignored. This will result in
	       possibly broken output, especially with the json or xml writer.

	   replace
	       The writer will substitute invalid UTF-8 sequences or code
	       points with the string specified with the
	       string_validation_replacement.

	   Default value is replace.

       string_validation_replacement, svr
	   Set replacement string to use in case string_validation is set to
	   replace.

	   In case the option is not specified, the writer will assume the
	   empty string, that is it will remove the invalid sequences from the
	   input strings.

       A description of the currently available writers follows.

   default
       Default format.

       Print each section in the form:

	       [SECTION]
	       key1=val1
	       ...
	       keyN=valN
	       [/SECTION]

       Metadata tags are printed as a line in the corresponding FORMAT, STREAM
       or PROGRAM_STREAM section, and are prefixed by the string "TAG:".

       A description of the accepted options follows.

       nokey, nk
	   If set to 1 specify not to print the key of each field. Default
	   value is 0.

       noprint_wrappers, nw
	   If set to 1 specify not to print the section header and footer.
	   Default value is 0.

   compact, csv
       Compact and CSV format.

       The "csv" writer is equivalent to "compact", but supports different
       defaults.

       Each section is printed on a single line.  If no option is specifid,
       the output has the form:

	       section|key1=val1| ... |keyN=valN

       Metadata tags are printed in the corresponding "format" or "stream"
       section. A metadata tag key, if printed, is prefixed by the string
       "tag:".

       The description of the accepted options follows.

       item_sep, s
	   Specify the character to use for separating fields in the output
	   line.  It must be a single printable character, it is "|" by
	   default ("," for the "csv" writer).

       nokey, nk
	   If set to 1 specify not to print the key of each field. Its default
	   value is 0 (1 for the "csv" writer).

       escape, e
	   Set the escape mode to use, default to "c" ("csv" for the "csv"
	   writer).

	   It can assume one of the following values:

	   c   Perform C-like escaping. Strings containing a newline (\n),
	       carriage return (\r), a tab (\t), a form feed (\f), the
	       escaping character (\) or the item separator character SEP are
	       escaped using C-like fashioned escaping, so that a newline is
	       converted to the sequence \n, a carriage return to \r, \ to \\
	       and the separator SEP is converted to \SEP.

	   csv Perform CSV-like escaping, as described in RFC4180.  Strings
	       containing a newline (\n), a carriage return (\r), a double
	       quote ("), or SEP are enclosed in double-quotes.

	   none
	       Perform no escaping.

       print_section, p
	   Print the section name at the begin of each line if the value is 1,
	   disable it with value set to 0. Default value is 1.

   flat
       Flat format.

       A free-form output where each line contains an explicit key=value, such
       as "streams.stream.3.tags.foo=bar". The output is shell escaped, so it
       can be directly embedded in sh scripts as long as the separator
       character is an alphanumeric character or an underscore (see sep_char
       option).

       The description of the accepted options follows.

       sep_char, s
	   Separator character used to separate the chapter, the section name,
	   IDs and potential tags in the printed field key.

	   Default value is ..

       hierarchical, h
	   Specify if the section name specification should be hierarchical.
	   If set to 1, and if there is more than one section in the current
	   chapter, the section name will be prefixed by the name of the
	   chapter. A value of 0 will disable this behavior.

	   Default value is 1.

   ini
       INI format output.

       Print output in an INI based format.

       The following conventions are adopted:

       ·   all key and values are UTF-8

       ·   . is the subgroup separator

       ·   newline, \t, \f, \b and the following characters are escaped

       ·   \ is the escape character

       ·   # is the comment indicator

       ·   = is the key/value separator

       ·   : is not used but usually parsed as key/value separator

       This writer accepts options as a list of key=value pairs, separated by
       :.

       The description of the accepted options follows.

       hierarchical, h
	   Specify if the section name specification should be hierarchical.
	   If set to 1, and if there is more than one section in the current
	   chapter, the section name will be prefixed by the name of the
	   chapter. A value of 0 will disable this behavior.

	   Default value is 1.

   json
       JSON based format.

       Each section is printed using JSON notation.

       The description of the accepted options follows.

       compact, c
	   If set to 1 enable compact output, that is each section will be
	   printed on a single line. Default value is 0.

       For more information about JSON, see <http://www.json.org/>.

   xml
       XML based format.

       The XML output is described in the XML schema description file
       ffprobe.xsd installed in the FFmpeg datadir.

       An updated version of the schema can be retrieved at the url
       <http://www.ffmpeg.org/schema/ffprobe.xsd>, which redirects to the
       latest schema committed into the FFmpeg development source code tree.

       Note that the output issued will be compliant to the ffprobe.xsd schema
       only when no special global output options (unit, prefix,
       byte_binary_prefix, sexagesimal etc.) are specified.

       The description of the accepted options follows.

       fully_qualified, q
	   If set to 1 specify if the output should be fully qualified.
	   Default value is 0.	This is required for generating an XML file
	   which can be validated through an XSD file.

       xsd_compliant, x
	   If set to 1 perform more checks for ensuring that the output is XSD
	   compliant. Default value is 0.  This option automatically sets
	   fully_qualified to 1.

       For more information about the XML format, see
       <http://www.w3.org/XML/>.

TIMECODE
       ffprobe supports Timecode extraction:

       ·   MPEG1/2 timecode is extracted from the GOP, and is available in the
	   video stream details (-show_streams, see timecode).

       ·   MOV timecode is extracted from tmcd track, so is available in the
	   tmcd stream metadata (-show_streams, see TAG:timecode).

       ·   DV, GXF and AVI timecodes are available in format metadata
	   (-show_format, see TAG:timecode).
